EVA Assignment 2.5

Problem Statement:

Inputs: Image of digit from MNIST dataset and random number between 0 and 9
To predict the digit in the Image and the Sum of the random number and the digit

Data representation and generation strategy:

For each image and for each number between 0 and 9, Augument the dataset with the the random number as another input data and sum as another output data.
Total datapoints = 60000(From MNIST) * 10(digits) = 6,00,000 datpoints.
Onehot encoding is used for both random number and summed number

Model:

-Conv2d - channels=10, kernel_size=5
-MaxPool2d(2,2)
-Conv2d -channels=16, kernel_size=3
-Dropout2d()
-MaxPool2d(2,2)
-FC - out_features=50
-FC - out_features=10   -> First Output digit classification

-Concat classification output and input random number

-FC - out_features=50
-FC - out_features=70
-FC - out_features=19   -> Second output which is sum of random number and digit

Result Evaluation:

Loss and number of correct outputs

Custom loss Function:

- Cross Entropy for classification
- MSE for Regression
- Combined as weighted sum
